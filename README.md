# pop-shell-custom-keybindings

Custom keybindings script for Pop Shell based on Sway/i3

Most of these keybindings can be modified using the gnome settings program or dconf editor, but this script ties them all to a single location and makes bulk updating much faster.

Note: Use this at your own risk. There is no undo. If you don't like the results, you can reset all bindings in the gnome settings program.
